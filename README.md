This is a [Astro](https://nextjs.org/) starter kit bootstrapped with `npm create astro@latest -- --template basics`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can also run the Astro template easily using Wasmer (check out the [install guide](https://docs.wasmer.io/install)):

```bash
npm run build
wasmer run . -- --port 3000
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Deploy on Wasmer Edge

The easiest way to deploy your Astro App is to use the [Wasmer Edge](https://wasmer.io/products/edge).

Live example: https://astro-wasmer-starter.wasmer.app/

First, you'll need to run `npm run build`, and then, to deploy to Wasmer Edge:

```bash
wasmer deploy
```

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
